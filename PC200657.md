# Santa Claus Arrives

As it is known, Santa Claus visits children every year on the evening of December 6th, rewarding both the good and the naughty based on how many C language programs they have written since his last visit.

Write a C function that receives three integer components of a valid date as parameters: a year, a month, and a day, in that order! The return value of the function should be the integer that indicates how many more sleeps there are until Santa Claus's next visit (counting `1` sleep per night and disregarding naps during the day)! In its calculations, take into account the occurrence of February 29th only in leap years! A year is a leap year if it is divisible by `4` but not by` 100`, or if it is divisible by `400`. The specification of the function should be as follows:

## Specification

```
int next_arrival(int, int, int);
```

## Note

Place the function in a file named `next_arrival.c` and submit this file as your solution to the evaluation system! You can test your solution with the help of the following two files using the sample input provided. However, the evaluation system may not necessarily use these files for assessing your solution.

## `main.c`

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main()
{
  int year, month, day;
  int next_arrival(int, int, int);
  while (scanf("%d %d %d", &year, &month, &day) != EOF)
  {
    int res = next_arrival(year, month, day);
    printf("%d\n", res);
  }
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

## Makefile

```make
CC = gcc
OBJS = main.o next_arrival.o
TARGETS = main
all: $(TARGETS)
main: $(OBJS)
$(CC) $(OBJS) -o main
main.o: main.c
$(CC) -c main.c
next_arrival.o: next_arrival.c
$(CC) -c next_arrival.c
clean:
rm -rf $(OBJS) *~ $(TARGETS)
```

## Sample input

2014 12 06
2014 12 07
2015 12 05

```
